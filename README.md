## About Project

Task:

Create a page that will have a button that counts the number of user clicks. Each time the user clicks the button, the counter should be incremented by one. Display the current counter value on the page.

Requirements:

- Create a `<button>` HTML element that will be visible on the page;
- Create an HTML element (eg `<p>` or `<span>`) that will display the current counter value (default is 0);
- Use CSS to style the button and counter so that the page looks attractive;
- Use JavaScript to add counter functionality. Each click on the button should increment the counter by one and update the display of the value on the page;
